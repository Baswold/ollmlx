# Archived Documentation

These files previously lived in the repository root. They have been gathered here to keep the project root focused on code while preserving historical context, test reports, and planning notes.

## What you'll find
- **Release and merge notes:** `MERGE_SUMMARY.md`, `CHANGELOG_OLLMLX.md`, `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md`.
- **Testing and verification reports:** `TESTING_GUIDE.md`, `TESTING_RESULTS.md`, `FINAL_TESTING_SUMMARY.md`, and the `test_results_*.md` series.
- **Project status and planning:** `CURRENT_STATUS.md`, `PROJECT_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`, `TODO*.md`, `VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md`.
- **Performance and analysis:** `PERFORMANCE_RESULTS.md`, `lobjc_analysis.md`, and other investigation logs.

Most references in the rest of the docs now point to this folder. If you add new long-form documentation that isn't part of the primary guides, please store it here to keep the repository root tidy.
